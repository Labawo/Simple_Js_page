                Hello there. My name is Laurynas and now I'm a 4th year Software Systems student at Kaunas University of Technology. <br><br>
                <b>Why did I chose this field?</b> <br><br> Well from a young age I always liked solving problems. <br><br>
                <b>And now you may be thinking that you can find problems in any field so why choose this one...</b> <br><br> I like to solve not just any type of problems but the ones in some way related to math (or logic if you like to call it that way). <br><br>
                <b>Then again you can say <i>"Why haven't you chosen math as your major?"</i></b> <br><br> To that I can say that I was always fascinated by computers and to be able to work with them and solve problems at the same time seemes like a dream came true.
            </p>

                I created this page to see what I can do with JS and what opportunities it can give me. <br><br>
                Althought this page is not that interactive and it does not involve any backend code. I think it gave me some understanding of page layout, some theoretical knowledge of necessary 
                topics related to the field I am studying and helped me to to create something that in my eyes is a functional and useful little project.
